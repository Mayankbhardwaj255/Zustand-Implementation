# 🧠 Habit Tracker App (with Zustand)

This is a simple yet powerful **Habit Tracker** built using **React** and **Zustand** — a fast and scalable state-management library. Instead of using Redux Toolkit, this project showcases how Zustand can handle state with less boilerplate and better developer experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add a new habit with a title and frequency (Daily / Weekly)
- Mark a habit as **Completed**
- Delete a habit
- Persist habits in `localStorage` using Zustand middleware
- Integrated Zustand **Devtools** for easy debugging

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Zustand** for state management
- Zustand middlewares: `persist` and `devtools`
- TailwindCSS / CSS (optional depending on your setup)

## 📦 Why Zustand over Redux Toolkit?

While Redux and Redux Toolkit are excellent for large-scale applications, Zustand offers a simpler and more intuitive approach for local and UI-related state. Here’s why Zustand was chosen:

| ✅ Feature           | Zustand                                | Redux Toolkit                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Boilerplate         | Extremely minimal                      | Moderate (requires slices/actions) |
| Setup Time          | Very quick                             | Requires multiple files and setup  |
| Learning Curve      | Easy to pick up                        | Slightly steeper                   |
| LocalStorage Persist| Built-in with `persist` middleware     | Needs manual setup                 |
| Devtools Support    | Yes, with `devtools` middleware        | Yes                                |
| Re-render Control   | Fine-grained, selective updates         | Possible, but more complex         |

🙌 Final Thoughts
Zustand offers a lean and developer-friendly alternative to Redux, especially for small-to-medium React apps. With this Habit Tracker, I was able to build a complete app with less code, simpler logic, and better performance.
